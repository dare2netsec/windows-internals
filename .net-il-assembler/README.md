# Notes from .NET IL Assembler by Serge Lidin

These notes are directly taken from the [book](https://www.amazon.com/NET-Assembler-Serge-Lidin/dp/1430267615/) mentioned above. They represent to me a summary of the __MOST important__ things I wanted to remember while I was reading this book. When time passes, I always need a quick reference to refresh my memory of what I learned, especially when I didn't have a chance to put into practice the learned knowledge or when my day to day job does not use any of it.
